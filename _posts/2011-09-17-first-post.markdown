Being dissatisfied with the current approach of blogging engined
throughout the web, such as tumblr.com, wordpress and the like I
stumbled over github's pages functionality. This is really what I was
looking for to host a blog on programming and functional software
development for the web. There is no need to edit and configure
everything a web interface, although these are currently very
comfortable.

As a programmer I am used to having files in different
directories on my machine and pushing them somewhere using my version
control. This comes with two huge advantages: I can incrementally add
features to my blog (currently it is only very rudimentary) and I can
update the technical posts, e.g. if new software versions make my
posts outdated.

Setup is really very simple I will not repeat this here, a blog post
on this can be found here

I hope I will be able to post some of my former posts here in the next
few days.
